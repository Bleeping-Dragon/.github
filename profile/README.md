<h2>🥸 Why that name?</h2>

<p>
  What do you think sounds better for a brand?
  <br>
  • Miguel Cano: A random name of a person? 😅
  <br>
  • Bleeping Dragon: Just sounds cooler. 😎
</p>

<p>
  The "Bleeping Dragon" brand allows to express creativity better through a nicer concept.
  Who doesn't love a cute dragon?
  <br><br>
  The darkest purple of the brand represents the majesty of that creature, the lighter shade of pink represents its bliss, the joyful temperament of that little beast.

  At the moment I'm working not making anything 😔ç
